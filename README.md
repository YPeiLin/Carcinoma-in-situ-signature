# Carcinoma-in-situ-signature
## Code in current repository can be used to regenerate analysis and figures from the study "Gene signatures characterizing driver mutations in lung squamous carcinoma are predictive of the progression of pre-cancer lesions".

In particular, Figure 2-5.R contains detailed visualization step and gene-signature-calculation.R contains the steps of deriving gene signatures from raw input
All data can be publicly downloaded based on GEO accession ID.
